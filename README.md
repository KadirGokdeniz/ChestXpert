## üîç About the Project

ChestXpert is a deep learning project developed for detecting 14 different lung diseases from chest X-rays. This project compares the performance of various modern CNN architectures (ResNet, Inception, MobileNet, VGG, AlexNet) and enhances diagnostic accuracy by integrating patient metadata (age, gender).

The project has localization capabilities by utilizing not only visual features but also bounding box information of disease regions. Models are equipped with explainable AI techniques, making it possible to visualize the reasoning behind the model's decisions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple CNN Architecture Support**: Implementation and comparison of ResNet, Inception, MobileNet, VGG, and AlexNet architectures
- **Multi-Modal Learning**: Integration of image data and patient metadata (age, gender)
- **Bounding Box Support**: Utilization of bounding box data for disease region localization
- **Explainable AI**: Visualization of model decisions with techniques like Grad-CAM and SHAP
- **Ensemble Learning**: Ensemble models combining the strengths of different architectures
- **Model Optimization**: Optimized models with techniques like quantization and pruning
- **Web Demo**: Interactive web interface for testing trained models

## üìä Dataset

The ChestXpert project is developed on 84,999 chest X-rays. This dataset:

- Contains 14 different lung disease classes
- Has metadata CSV files with patient age and gender information
- Includes bounding box data marking disease regions for some images

> **Note**: The dataset used in this README may not be real and might have been created for educational purposes. When using a real dataset, make sure to follow the relevant dataset license and citation requirements.

## üß† Model Architectures

The ChestXpert project supports the following CNN architectures:

1. **ResNet50**: Deep residual networks that use skip connections to enhance classification performance
2. **InceptionV3**: Features parallel convolution blocks for multi-scale processing and dimension reduction techniques
3. **MobileNetV2**: A lightweight architecture optimized for mobile and embedded devices
4. **VGG16**: A classic deep CNN architecture known for its simple structure
5. **AlexNet**: A pioneer of modern CNNs, included for historical comparison

Additionally, custom hybrid models that combine and extend these base architectures are supported:

- **MetadataNet**: Custom architecture that combines CNN features with patient metadata
- **AttentionNet**: Model using attention mechanisms for disease localization
- **EnsembleNet**: Ensemble model combining the strengths of different architectures
